## Prologue: King Boo Appears

Sofia had traversed the entire Water World. She learned about authentication, cloud models, software architecture, advanced deploy, Git workflows, data structures, cache, performance, and messaging. She was feeling powerful.

But then, upon reaching the final castle of World 4, the lights went out. A laugh echoed through the walls.

*"Boo hoo hoo!"*

**King Boo** appeared floating in the center of the hall — the invisible ghost that tests your ability to think about architecture.

*"Sofia,"* said King Boo with a mysterious smile, *"the challenges I bring are different. It's not enough to know what JWT, cache, or microservices are. You need to know WHEN to use them, WHY to use them, and HOW to combine everything. My challenges are invisible — there's no obvious answer. You need to THINK."*

Yoshi nudged Sofia's shoulder. *"King Boo is the trickiest boss. He doesn't attack with strength — he attacks with confusion. The problems seem simple, but they have layers. Like every good Mario boss, you need to find the pattern."*

Sofia took a deep breath. *"Let's go."*

## 2. Challenge 1: Designing the Authentication System

*Level 4-1: Auth, JWT, OAuth | Difficulty: ** Koopa*

### 2.1 The Scenario

The TodoApp has grown and now needs a robust authentication system. Currently, anyone can access any API endpoint without identifying themselves. You need to protect the system.

**System users:**
- **Regular users**: Create and manage their own tasks
- **Moderators**: Can view and edit any user's tasks
- **Admins**: Can do everything, including managing users and settings

### 2.2 Requirements

1. Login with email/password (local)
2. Login with Google (OAuth)
3. JWT for stateless authentication
4. RBAC with 3 roles: user, moderator, admin
5. Rate limiting on the login endpoint
6. Refresh token for session renewal

### 2.3 Exercise: Flow Diagram

**Draw the sequence diagram for each flow:**

```
Exercise A: Registration flow with email/password
  - Client sends data → API validates → Hash password → Save to database → Generate JWT → Return

Exercise B: Login flow with Google (OAuth)
  - Client clicks "Login with Google" → Redirect → Google authenticates → Callback → Create/find user → Generate JWT → Return

Exercise C: Token renewal flow
  - Access token expired → Client sends refresh token → API validates → Generate new access token → Return
```

**Your drawing here:**

```
(Draw the diagram using ASCII art or a tool of your choice)

Tip: Use the format:
  Client → API → Database
      ←           ←
```

### 2.4 Exercise: JWT Implementation

**Complete the code:**

```javascript
// TODO: Complete the authentication middleware
function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // 1. Extract token from Authorization header
  // Format: "Bearer <token>"
  // YOUR CODE HERE

  // 2. Check if token exists
  // YOUR CODE HERE

  // 3. Decode and validate the token
  // YOUR CODE HERE

  // 4. Add user data to req
  // YOUR CODE HERE

  // 5. Call next() if everything is OK
  // YOUR CODE HERE
}

// TODO: Complete the authorization middleware
function requireRole(allowedRoles) {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    // 1. Check if req.user exists (already authenticated)
    // YOUR CODE HERE

    // 2. Check if the user's role is in the allowed roles list
    // YOUR CODE HERE

    // 3. If authorized, next(). If not, 403 Forbidden.
    // YOUR CODE HERE
  };
}

// TODO: Apply the middlewares to routes
const router = express.Router();

// Any authenticated user
router.get('/api/todos', /* YOUR CODE */, getTodos);

// Moderator or admin only
router.get('/api/todos/all', /* YOUR CODE */, getAllTodos);

// Admin only
router.delete('/api/users/:id', /* YOUR CODE */, deleteUser);
```

### 2.5 Exercise: RBAC for the TodoApp

**Create the complete permissions table:**

```
Copy and fill in the table:

| Action                        | User | Moderator | Admin |
|-------------------------------|:----:|:---------:|:-----:|
| View own tasks                |      |           |       |
| Create task                   |      |           |       |
| Edit own task                 |      |           |       |
| Delete own task               |      |           |       |
| View others' tasks            |      |           |       |
| Edit others' tasks            |      |           |       |
| Delete others' tasks          |      |           |       |
| View user list                |      |           |       |
| Create user                   |      |           |       |
| Delete user                   |      |           |       |
| Change roles                  |      |           |       |
| View settings                 |      |           |       |
| Change settings               |      |           |       |
```

## 3. Challenge 2: Choose the Right Architecture

*Levels 4-2 and 4-3: Cloud Models + Architecture | Difficulty: *** Hammer Bro*

### 3.1 Scenario A: Startup with 3 Devs

**Context**: A startup with 3 developers wants to build a task management app for teams. They have an MVP to deliver in 2 months. Limited budget. They don't know if they'll have 100 or 100,000 users.

**Answer:**

1. Which architectural style? (Monolith, microservices, serverless?)
2. Which cloud model? (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, Serverless?)
3. Which specific Azure service?
4. Which database?
5. Justify EACH choice with advantages and trade-offs.

```
Your Plan:
  Architecture: _______________
  Reason: _______________

  Cloud model: _______________

# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
# TODO: Complete the pipeline with:
# 1. Build and tests
# 2. Deploy to staging
# 3. Integration tests on staging
# 4. Deploy to production (with manual approval)
# 5. Post-deploy health check
# 6. Automatic rollback if health check fails

| Cache     |               |                |      |
```

---

## 5. Challenge 4: Cache and Performance Under Pressure

*Levels 4-6 and 4-7: Data Structures + Cache | Difficulty: *** Hammer Bro*

### 5.1 The Scenario

The TodoApp is slow. Users complain that the task list takes 4 seconds to load. You investigated and found the following problems:

1. The main query does N+1 (fetches user, then fetches each user's tasks individually)
2. There is no cache of any kind
3. Avatar images are served directly from the server (no CDN)
4. The frontend loads ALL components at once (no lazy loading)
5. The task search runs a database query on EVERY keystroke

### 5.2 Exercise: Performance Diagnosis

**For each problem, identify:**

```markdown
| Problem | Impact (ms) | World 4 Level | Solution |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| N+1 query |            | 4-7           |          |
| No cache |            | 4-7           |          |
| No CDN   |            | 4-7           |          |
| No lazy loading |     | 4-7           |          |
| Query on every keystroke |   | 4-6    |          |
```

### 5.3 Exercise: Cache Strategy

**Design the complete cache strategy:**

```markdown
## What to Cache:
| Data | Where to Cache | TTL | Strategy | Invalidation |
|------|---------------|-----|----------|-------------|
| User's task list |  |  |  |  |
| User profile |  |  |  |  |
| Search results |  |  |  |  |
| Static assets |  |  |  |  |
| Global settings |  |  |  |  |
```

### 5.4 Exercise: Optimize the API

**Rewrite the optimized endpoint:**

```javascript
// BEFORE: Slow (4 seconds)
app.get('/api/todos', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await db.users.findById(req.user.id);
  const todos = [];
  const todoIds = await db.todos.findIds({ userId: user.id });
  for (const id of todoIds) {
    const todo = await db.todos.findById(id);
    const tags = await db.tags.findByTodoId(id);
    todo.tags = tags;
    todos.push(todo);
  }
  res.json(todos);
});

// AFTER: Optimized
// TODO: Rewrite with:
// 1. Cache (Redis)
// 2. Optimized query (no N+1)
// 3. Pagination
// 4. Compressed response
app.get('/api/todos', async (req, res) => {
  // YOUR CODE HERE
});
```

---

## 6. Challenge 5: Designing Messaging

*Level 4-8: Messaging | Difficulty: *** Hammer Bro*

### 6.1 The Scenario

The TodoApp needs to implement the following asynchronous features:

1. **Send email** when a task is created
2. **Send push notification** when a task is assigned to someone
3. **Generate PDF report** when the user requests it
4. **Sync with Google Calendar** when task has a date
5. **Record audit log** for every action

### 6.2 Exercise: Event Diagram

**Draw the architecture diagram showing:**

- Which events exist
- Which services publish which events
- Which services consume which events
- Which pattern to use (queue vs pub/sub)

```
Your diagram:

Producer(s)          Broker              Consumer(s)
┌──────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│          │────→│              │────→│              │
│          │     │              │     │              │
└──────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘

(Complete with actual services and events)
```

### 6.3 Exercise: Implement Producer and Consumer

```javascript
// TODO: Implement the producer that publishes events
// when a task is created
async function createTodoWithEvents(userId, todoData) {
  // 1. Create task in database
  // YOUR CODE

  // 2. Publish 'todo.created' event
  // YOUR CODE

  // 3. If it has a date, publish 'todo.calendar_sync_needed' event
  // YOUR CODE

  // 4. Return the created task
  // YOUR CODE
}

// TODO: Implement the notification consumer
// that processes 'todo.created' events
async function notificationConsumer(message) {
  // 1. Extract event data
  // YOUR CODE

  // 2. Fetch user notification preferences
  // YOUR CODE

  // 3. Send email IF user has email notifications enabled
  // YOUR CODE

  // 4. Send push IF user has push notifications enabled
  // YOUR CODE

  // 5. ACK the message
  // YOUR CODE
}
```

### 6.4 Exercise: Dead Letter Handling

**Describe what to do when each type of failure occurs:**

```markdown
| Failure | Likely Cause | Retry? | Max Retries | Action on DLQ |
|---------|-------------|:------:|:-----------:|---------------|
| Email not sent |  |  |  |  |
| Push notification failed |  |  |  |  |
| PDF not generated |  |  |  |  |
| Calendar sync failed |  |  |  |  |
| Message with invalid format |  |  |  |  |
```

## 9. Answer Key and Tips

**General tips for the challenges:**

**Challenge 1 (Auth):**
- Remember: Authentication ALWAYS before Authorization
- JWT for stateless APIs, sessions for traditional apps
- NEVER store passwords in plain text — always bcrypt
- Rate limiting is essential on the login endpoint

**Challenge 2 (Architecture):**
- Startup with 3 devs → Monolith is almost always the right answer
- 50 devs with legacy system → Strangler Fig to migrate gradually
- IoT with variable traffic → Serverless + Event Hub

**Challenge 3 (Deploy):**
- 50,000 users → Canary is the safest strategy
- Always have feature flags for new features
- Pipeline should include: build → test → staging → production
- Database rollback is the most dangerous — plan carefully

**Challenge 4 (Cache):**
- Cache-aside is the simplest and most effective strategy
- Redis for frequent data, CDN for static assets
- Debounce for searches (wait for user to stop typing)
- Include/eager loading to eliminate N+1

**Challenge 5 (Messaging):**
- Email and notification → Pub/Sub (multiple consumers)
- PDF → Queue (one dedicated consumer)
- Audit → Pub/Sub (subscribes to ALL events)
- Always implement idempotency in consumers

**Challenge 6 (Final Boss):**
- Start with a modular monolith (MVC or Clean Architecture)
- PaaS (App Service) to maintain simplicity
- PostgreSQL with Redis as cache
