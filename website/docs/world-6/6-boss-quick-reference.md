## SECTION 0: Introduction

### The Mushroom Kingdom Map

Sofia discovered the **Complete Map of the Mushroom Kingdom** — a detailed map showing all the levels, Warp Zones, Power-Ups, characters, and secrets of the vast Agentic DevOps world. This document is your quick reference, your magic compass for navigating any situation, your definitive consultation guide.

Here you'll find everything you've learned in one place, organized like a Mario game map: levels clearly marked, items identified, and secret paths revealed. It's a quick-reference tool, a **cheat sheet** to save the day when you need to remember that specific detail.

> Remember those maps that came in the manuals of old Mario games? This document is EXACTLY that — but for Agentic DevOps!

## SECTION 2: Decision Table: "What Should I Create?"

### 6 Real Scenarios and the Correct Answer

| # | Scenario | What to Create | File | Mario Analogy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Specialized companion | **Agent** | `.agent.md` | Select a character on the selection screen (Mario, Luigi, Toad...) |
| 2 | Teach a skill to Copilot | **Skill** | `SKILL.md` | Grab a Power-Up from the "?" Block (Mushroom, Fire Flower, Star...) |
| 3 | Rules that always apply | **Instruction** | `.instructions.md` | Gravity, lava kills — always-active rules, nobody needs to remember |
| 4 | Reusable command | **Prompt** | `.prompt.md` | Enter a Warp Pipe (green pipe) — direct shortcut to where you need |
| 5 | External tool | **MCP** | `mcp.json` | Open a Warp Zone to another world (Figma, PostgreSQL, Slack...) |
| 6 | Automation on commit/push | **Hook** | `.github/workflows` | Hit an automatic "?" Block — something happens without you asking |

### When to Use Each — Visual Guide

> **Need a new character?** -> Agent (`.agent.md`)
> **Need a new power?** -> Skill (`SKILL.md`)
> **Need a new rule?** -> Instruction (`.instructions.md`)
> **Need a shortcut?** -> Prompt (`.prompt.md`)
> **Need to connect another world?** -> MCP (`mcp.json`)
> **Need automation?** -> Hook (Husky/GitHub Actions)

---

## SECTION 5: The 4 Worlds (Workflows)

### Quick Map of Each World

#### World 1: FEATURE (Super Mushroom)
```
Level 1-1: Plan      -> Look at the map, plan the route
Level 1-2: Implement -> Run through the level, collect coins, jump obstacles
Level 1-3: Review    -> Checkpoint — check if you got everything
Level 1-4: Verify    -> Boss Battle — Bowser Jr + Boom Boom + Kamek + Bowser
```

#### World 2: BUGFIX (Super Star)
```
Level 2-1: Reproduce -> Find where the enemy appears
Level 2-2: Debug     -> Investigate why the enemy is there
Level 2-3: Fix       -> Defeat the enemy
Level 2-4: Test      -> Verify it doesn't come back
```

#### World 3: DEPLOY (Cape Feather)
```
Level 3-1: Build  -> Build the castle
Level 3-2: Test   -> Test if the doors open
Level 3-3: Lint   -> Check for traps
Level 3-4: Verify -> Open the doors to the public
```

#### World 4: CODE REVIEW (Fire Flower)
```
Level 4-1: Lint     -> Check style (coins aligned?)
Level 4-2: Security -> Check for hidden traps
Level 4-3: Review   -> Play the entire level as a test
Level 4-4: Approve  -> "CLEAR!" — level approved!
```

---

## SECTION 6: Boss Battles (Final Gates)

### The 4 Bosses You Need to Defeat

| Boss | Mario Character | What It Checks | If You Lose... |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Boss 1: TSC** | Bowser Jr | Correct TypeScript types, zero errors | Go back to the level and fix the types |
| **Boss 2: Jest** | Boom Boom | All tests passing (100%) | Go back and fix the tests |
| **Boss 3: ESLint** | Kamek (Magikoopa) | Code quality, zero warnings | Go back and clean up the code |
| **Boss 4: Zero Any** | Bowser | No `any` in TypeScript | Go back and define all types |

> **Golden Rule:** You only move to the next World when ALL 4 Bosses are defeated. No exceptions!

---

## SECTION 7: The 6 Power-Up Layers (Context)

### Power-Up Slots that Stack

| Layer | Power-Up Slot | Who Controls | Mario Analogy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Personal** | Your play style | The individual | Player preference ("I always play with Mario") |
| **2. Organization** | Tournament rules | Technical leadership | Championship rules ("everyone uses standard controller") |
| **3. Repository** | This World's rules | Repo maintainers | This world's rules ("here the Koopas slide on ice") |
| **4. Path-Specific** | Area rules | Specialists | Level rules ("in water, Mario swims; in sky, flies") |
| **5. Agent** | Character powers | Agent owner | Character card ("Luigi jumps higher") |
| **6. User Prompt** | Command NOW | You! | "Jump!", "Shoot!", "Run!" |

> **Stacking:** All layers ADD UP. Mario doesn't lose gravity when he grabs Fire Flower. Similarly, an Agent doesn't lose the repository rules when it receives a prompt. MAXIMUM POWER-UP!

---

## SECTION 8: Warp Zones (MCP)

### Map of Connected Worlds

| Warp Zone | Destination World | Main Tools | What It's For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Figma MCP** | World of Designs | `get_design_data`, `get_colors`, `get_typography` | Fetch colors, typography, visual components |
| **PostgreSQL MCP** | Underground World of Data | `query`, `get_schema`, `list_tables` | Run queries, explore tables, fetch data |
| **Azure Boards MCP** | World of Tasks | `create_work_item`, `update_work_item`, `list_work_items` | Create/update tasks, check sprints |
| **GitHub MCP** | World of Repos | `list_repos`, `get_issue`, `create_pull_request` | Access issues, PRs, code in other repos |
| **Slack MCP** | World of Communication | `send_message`, `list_channels` | Send and read team messages |

> **Security:** The Warp Zone key (API Key) is NEVER exposed. Keep it in your secret pocket (`.env`) and only show it when you need to enter!

## SECTION 12: Your Journey Continues

### Congratulations, Sofia!

You've completed the journey through the entire Mushroom Kingdom and discovered the **Complete Map**! You now possess the knowledge to navigate any Agentic DevOps challenge. All Worlds have been unlocked, all Bosses have been defeated, all Power-Ups have been collected!

### Your 7 Final Quests (Post-Game)

Like every good Mario game, after defeating Bowser there's still post-game content! Here are your 7 final Star Coins to collect:

**Quest 1 — The First Character:** Create your first agent (`.agent.md`) for a personal project. Choose: who will be your Mario?

**Quest 2 — The Power-Up Shop:** Write 3 skills (`SKILL.md`) for your most common workflows. Build your shop!

**Quest 3 — The World Rules:** Configure instructions for code standards. Define your world's gravity!

**Quest 4 — The Warp Pipes:** Create 4 prompt files for common tasks. Build your shortcuts!

**Quest 5 — The Warp Zones:** Integrate 2 MCP servers (Figma, Slack, PostgreSQL...). Open portals to other worlds!

**Quest 6 — The "?" Blocks:** Configure hooks with GitHub Actions. Install automatic traps!

**Quest 7 — Multiplayer Mode:** Complete orchestration with multiple agents working as a team. Activate multiplayer!

### Survival Tips for the Mushroom Kingdom

1. **Start small** — Mario starts as Small Mario before grabbing the Mushroom. Create simple agents first.
2. **Test everything in isolation** — Don't face Bowser without training on Goombas first.
3. **Document as you create** — A good map saves lives. Write down what works.
4. **Reuse and share** — Power-Ups are shareable. Don't reinvent the wheel.
5. **Monitor your agents** — Keep an eye on what your characters are doing.
6. **Iterate and version** — Each version is a New Game+. Always improve.
7. **Contribute to the community** — Share your maps and Power-Ups with other players!
