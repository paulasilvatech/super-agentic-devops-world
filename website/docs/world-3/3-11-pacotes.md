## Prologue: The Overstuffed Backpack

Sofia started building her TodoApp. She needed an HTTP server -- she found Express. She needed to validate data -- she found Zod. She needed to connect to the database -- she found Prisma. She needed to format dates -- she found date-fns. She needed authentication -- she found jsonwebtoken.

In a few hours, her project had 47 direct dependencies and... 1,247 indirect dependencies. The `node_modules` folder weighed 300 MB.

Sofia stared at the terminal in shock. *"How did 47 items turn into 1,247?!"*

Toad -- the guardian of treasures and data -- appeared carrying a giant backpack that barely fit on his back.

*"Sofia, welcome to the world of DEPENDENCIES. Each item you pick up from the shop comes with other items inside -- which in turn come with MORE items inside. It's like an infinite matryoshka doll. You asked for 47 things, but each thing needed another 25 to work."*

Toad dropped the backpack on the floor. Items fell everywhere.

*"The secret is not to avoid dependencies -- it's to MANAGE them. Welcome to Level 3-11: the inventory system."*

---

## 1. What Are Packages and Dependencies?

### 1.1 Packages: Shop Items

A **package** is a piece of code that someone wrote and published for others to use. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you install the package and use it.

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** Packages are **items from Toad's Shop**. Instead of crafting your own Mushroom (authentication code), you go to Toad's Shop (npm, pip) and buy a ready-made Mushroom (jsonwebtoken package). Someone already did the hard work. You just install and use it.

**Examples of popular packages:**

| Package | Language | What it does | Downloads/month |
|---------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **express** | JavaScript | HTTP server | ~30 million |
| **react** | JavaScript | User interface | ~25 million |
| **lodash** | JavaScript | General utilities | ~50 million |
| **requests** | Python | HTTP requests | ~30 million |
| **pandas** | Python | Data manipulation | ~20 million |
| **Newtonsoft.Json** | C# | Serialize/deserialize JSON | ~15 million |

### 1.2 Dependencies: Items that Need Other Items

A **dependency** is a package that YOUR project needs to work. And your dependencies can also have dependencies (transitive dependencies):

```
Your Project
├── express (you installed)
│   ├── accepts (express needs)
│   ├── body-parser (express needs)
│   │   ├── bytes (body-parser needs)
│   │   ├── content-type (body-parser needs)
│   │   ├── depd (body-parser needs)
│   │   └── ... (5 more dependencies)
│   ├── cookie (express needs)
│   └── ... (25 more dependencies)
├── prisma (you installed)
│   └── ... (15 more dependencies)
└── zod (you installed -- ZERO dependencies! Rare and admirable)
```

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** It's like an RPG item system. The **Fire Flower** (Express) needs a **Mushroom** (body-parser) to work. The Mushroom needs **Coins** (bytes, content-type). The Coins need... and so on. You asked for ONE Fire Flower, but it brought along an entire chain of items.

### 1.3 Why Not Build Everything from Scratch?

| Build from scratch | Use a package | Verdict |
|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| Write HTTP server: ~2000 lines | `npm install express`: 5 seconds | Package |
| Write JSON parser: ~500 lines | Already comes with Node.js | Don't reinvent |
| Write a sum function: 3 lines | Install lodash just for `_.sum()` | Do it yourself |
| Write JWT auth: ~800 lines (and dangerous!) | `npm install jsonwebtoken` | PACKAGE (security!) |

**Practical rule:** If it's simple (< 20 lines) and doesn't involve security, do it yourself. If it's complex or involves security/cryptography, use a trusted package.

## 2. Package Managers: The Item Shops

### 2.1 npm and Yarn (JavaScript/TypeScript)

**npm** (Node Package Manager) is the default manager for Node.js. **Yarn** is an alternative created by Facebook with extra features.

```bash
# npm -- Essential commands

# Initialize project (creates package.json)
npm init -y

# Install dependency
npm install express          # Production dependency
npm install -D jest          # DEVELOPMENT dependency (devDep)
npm install -g nodemon       # Install GLOBALLY (on the machine)

# Install all dependencies from package.json
npm install                  # or simply: npm i

# Remove dependency
npm uninstall express

# Update dependencies
npm update                   # Updates within allowed ranges
npm outdated                 # Shows what is outdated

# Run scripts defined in package.json
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build

# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** npm is **Toad's Shop** -- the largest item shop in the Mushroom Kingdom, with more than 2 million items (packages) available. `npm install` is walking into the shop and saying "I want that item." `npm audit` is the inspector checking if any item is spoiled or poisoned.

**pnpm** is another alternative, more efficient in disk space (uses hard links to avoid duplicating packages):

```bash
# pnpm -- same interface, more efficient storage
pnpm install express
pnpm add -D jest
```

### 2.2 pip (Python)

```bash
# pip -- Python package manager

# Install package
pip install requests
pip install django==5.0       # Specific version
pip install "fastapi>=0.100"  # Minimum version

# Install from a file
pip install -r requirements.txt

# List installed packages
pip list
pip freeze                    # Format for requirements.txt

# Update package
pip install --upgrade requests

# Uninstall
pip uninstall requests

# Check for vulnerabilities
pip audit                     # (need to install pip-audit)
```

### 2.3 NuGet (C# / .NET)

```bash
# NuGet -- via .NET CLI

# Install package
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore --version 8.0.0

# List packages
dotnet list package

# Update
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --version 13.0.3

# Restore (install all dependencies)
dotnet restore
```

### 2.4 Other Managers

| Manager | Language | Config File | Registry |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **cargo** | Rust | Cargo.toml | crates.io |
| **go mod** | Go | go.mod | proxy.golang.org |
| **composer** | PHP | composer.json | packagist.org |
| **gem** | Ruby | Gemfile | rubygems.org |
| **Maven/Gradle** | Java | pom.xml / build.gradle | Maven Central |

### 2.5 Comparison Table

| Aspect | npm | pip | NuGet | cargo |
|--------|-----|-----|-------|-------|
| **Language** | JS/TS | Python | C# | Rust |
| **Registry** | npmjs.com | pypi.org | nuget.org | crates.io |
| **Config file** | package.json | requirements.txt / pyproject.toml | .csproj | Cargo.toml |
| **Lock file** | package-lock.json | None (use pip-tools) | packages.lock.json | Cargo.lock |
| **Install folder** | node_modules/ | site-packages/ | ~/.nuget/ | target/ |
| **No. of packages** | ~2.5 million | ~500 thousand | ~400 thousand | ~150 thousand |
| **Mario Analogy** | Toad's Shop (huge) | Mage's Shop | Royal Forge | Fortress Shop |

## 3. package.json: The Official Inventory

### 3.1 Anatomy of package.json

The `package.json` is the central file of any Node.js/JavaScript project:

```json
{
  "name": "todoapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Aplicacao de tarefas do Mushroom Kingdom",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "type": "module",

  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js",
    "start": "node src/index.js",
    "build": "tsc",
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint src/",
    "format": "prettier --write src/"
  },

  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "prisma": "^5.10.0",
    "zod": "^3.22.0",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.0"
  },

  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^29.7.0",
    "typescript": "^5.3.0",
    "eslint": "^8.56.0",
    "prettier": "^3.2.0",
    "nodemon": "^3.0.0",
    "@types/express": "^4.17.21"
  },

  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  },

  "license": "MIT",
  "author": "Sofia <sofia@mushroom.kingdom>"
}
```

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** The `package.json` is the **official inventory list**. Each field tells you something:
> - `name` = Adventurer's name
> - `version` = Current level (SemVer!)
> - `scripts` = Command shortcuts (quick magic)
> - `dependencies` = Essential items for the adventure
> - `devDependencies` = Training-only items (don't go to production)
> - `engines` = "Requires Nintendo console version 18+"

### 3.2 dependencies vs devDependencies

| Type | When to use | Goes to production? | Example |
|------|------------|---------------------|---------|
| **dependencies** | Code NEEDS it to run | YES | express, react, prisma |
| **devDependencies** | Only needed for DEVELOPMENT | NO | jest, eslint, typescript |
| **peerDependencies** | Plugin that expects you already have it | Depends | @types/react (expects react is already there) |

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** `dependencies` are items that Mario NEEDS in the real battle (Fire Flower, Mushroom). `devDependencies` are training items that stay at the practice field (test dummies, study maps). You don't bring training dummies to the final battle!

```bash
# Install as production dependency
npm install express

# Install as DEVELOPMENT dependency
npm install -D jest

# Install ONLY production dependencies (deploy)
npm install --production
# or
npm ci --production
```

### 3.3 Scripts: Magic Shortcuts

Scripts in package.json are shortcuts for frequent commands:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js",
    "start": "node src/index.js",
    "build": "tsc && npm run lint",
    "test": "jest --coverage",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "lint": "eslint src/",
    "lint:fix": "eslint src/ --fix",
    "format": "prettier --write src/",
    "db:migrate": "prisma migrate dev",
    "db:seed": "prisma db seed",
    "docker:up": "docker-compose up -d",
    "docker:down": "docker-compose down"
  }
}
```

```bash
# Run scripts
npm run dev          # Start in development mode
npm test             # Run tests (shortcut: npm t)
npm run build        # Compile the project
npm run lint:fix     # Automatically fix lint issues
```

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** Scripts are **magic shortcuts** -- instead of typing the entire spell every time ("nodemon src/index.js"), you shout "DEV!" and the magic happens. Every competent adventurer has their shortcuts memorized.

### 3.4 Creating a package.json from Scratch

```bash
# Option 1: Interactive (answers questions)
npm init

# Option 2: Automatic default (no questions)
npm init -y

# Option 3: For modern TypeScript projects
npm init -y && npm install -D typescript @types/node ts-node
npx tsc --init
```

---

## 4. requirements.txt and pyproject.toml: The Python Inventory

### 4.1 Basic requirements.txt

```bash
# requirements.txt -- simple format
fastapi==0.109.0
uvicorn==0.27.0
sqlalchemy>=2.0,<3.0
pydantic>=2.0
python-dotenv~=1.0.0
requests>=2.31.0
```

```bash
# Install everything
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate from current environment
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 4.2 Virtual Environments: Separate Backpacks

In Python, **virtual environments** isolate each project's dependencies:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Now pip installs in THIS environment, not globally
pip install fastapi

# Deactivate
deactivate
```

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** Virtual environments are like **separate backpacks for each mission**. On the Bowser's Castle mission, you bring Fire Flower and Star. On the underwater mission, you bring Frog Suit and Penguin Suit. If you put everything in a single backpack, it gets heavy and confusing.

### 4.3 pyproject.toml: The Modern Inventory

The modern format for Python projects:

```toml
[project]
name = "todoapp"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "TodoApp do Mushroom Kingdom"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.109.0",
    "uvicorn>=0.27.0",
    "sqlalchemy>=2.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=8.0",
    "black>=24.0",
    "mypy>=1.8",
]
```

---

## 5. Lock Files: Freezing the Exact Versions

### 5.1 The Problem Lock Files Solve

Imagine this scenario without a lock file:

```
MONDAY:
Sofia runs "npm install"
express installed: 4.18.2
Everything works!

TUESDAY:
Express releases version 4.18.3 (with a bug!)
Colleague runs "npm install"
express installed: 4.18.3
EVERYTHING BREAKS!

"But it works on my machine!" -- the most hated phrase in development
```

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** Without a lock file, it's as if Toad's Shop changed items all the time. You bought a Mushroom on Monday -- it was red, makes you grow. On Tuesday, your friend bought "the same" Mushroom -- but now it's purple and poisons you. Lock file freezes it: "this Mushroom is EXACTLY version 4.18.2, with EXACTLY these properties."

### 5.2 package-lock.json Explained

The `package-lock.json` records the **EXACT version** of EVERY dependency (direct and transitive):

```json
{
  "name": "todoapp",
  "lockfileVersion": 3,
  "packages": {
    "node_modules/express": {
      "version": "4.18.2",           // EXACTLY this version
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.18.2.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-abc123...",  // Hash to verify integrity
      "dependencies": {
        "accepts": "~1.3.8",
        "body-parser": "1.20.1",
        "cookie": "0.5.0"
      }
    },
    "node_modules/body-parser": {
      "version": "1.20.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/body-parser/-/body-parser-1.20.1.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-def456..."
    }
  }
}
```

**`npm ci` vs `npm install`:**

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Reads package.json, resolves versions, updates lock file | Development (adding packages) |
| `npm ci` | Reads package-lock.json, installs EXACT versions | CI/CD and production (reproduce environment) |

```bash
# In development: npm install (flexible)
npm install

# In CI/CD and deploy: npm ci (exact, reproducible)
npm ci
```

### 5.3 Golden Rules for Lock Files

1. **ALWAYS** commit the lock file to the repository
2. **NEVER** edit the lock file manually
3. Use `npm ci` in CI/CD pipelines
4. If the lock file causes a merge conflict, delete it and run `npm install`
5. Review lock file updates in PRs -- unexpected changes may indicate a problem

---

## 6. Dependency Versioning: Ranges

### 6.1 Tilde (~) and Caret (^)

When you declare a dependency in package.json, you use **ranges** to indicate which versions are accepted:

| Notation | Meaning | Example | Accepts |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| `^4.18.2` | Accepts MINOR and PATCH | `^4.18.2` | 4.18.2, 4.18.3, 4.19.0, 4.99.9 (NOT 5.0.0) |
| `~4.18.2` | Accepts only PATCH | `~4.18.2` | 4.18.2, 4.18.3, 4.18.99 (NOT 4.19.0) |
| `4.18.2` | EXACTLY this one | `4.18.2` | Only 4.18.2 |

> **MARIO ANALOGY:**
> - `^4.18.2` (caret) = "I accept any Mushroom from family 4, as long as it doesn't change drastically" -- accepts improvements and fixes, but not incompatible versions.
> - `~4.18.2` (tilde) = "I accept only bug fixes for this specific Mushroom" -- more conservative.
> - `4.18.2` (fixed) = "I want EXACTLY this Mushroom, don't change anything" -- maximum control.

### 6.2 Other Ranges

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",       // >= 4.18.2 and < 5.0.0
    "lodash": "~4.17.21",       // >= 4.17.21 and < 4.18.0
    "react": "18.2.0",          // Exactly 18.2.0
    "zod": ">=3.0.0",           // Anything >= 3.0.0
    "prisma": ">=5.0.0 <6.0.0", // Explicit range
    "typescript": "*",          // Any version (DANGER!)
    "jest": "latest"            // Latest version (DANGER IN PRODUCTION!)
  }
}
```

### 6.3 Which One to Use?

| Scenario | Recommendation | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Application (final project) | `^` (caret) | Receives patches and minor features |
| Library (published on npm) | `^` (caret) | Flexibility for consumers |
| Critical environment (production) | Exact version | Maximum predictability |
| Dependency with history of breaking changes | `~` (tilde) | More conservative |
| **NEVER in production** | `*` or `latest` | Unpredictable! |

---

## 7. Dependency Hell: When Items Conflict

### 7.1 What Is Dependency Hell

**Dependency Hell** is when your dependencies conflict with each other -- one needs version X, another needs version Y, and X and Y are incompatible.

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** Dependency Hell is when your **items conflict with each other**. The Fire Flower requires Mushroom version 2.0. But the Cape requires Mushroom version 1.5. And Mushroom 2.0 and 1.5 cannot coexist in the backpack. Result: you can't equip Fire Flower AND Cape at the same time. Your backpack is in conflict. Dependency Hell.

### 7.2 Types of Conflict

**1. Direct version conflict:**

```
Your project
├── package-A requires lodash@^4.0.0
└── package-B requires lodash@^3.0.0   // CONFLICT! 4.x and 3.x are incompatible
```

**2. Diamond dependency:**

```
        Your Project
       /           \
   package-A      package-B
       \           /
        package-C
  (A wants C@2.0, B wants C@1.0)
```

**3. Unsatisfied peer dependency:**

```bash
# Classic error:
npm WARN peerDependencies react@18.0.0 required by some-library@1.0.0
# You have react@17.0.0, but the library wants react@18
```

### 7.3 How to Resolve Conflicts

```bash
# 1. View the dependency tree
npm ls
npm ls lodash    # See who depends on lodash

# 2. Force resolution (package.json)
{
  "overrides": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}

# 3. Clean and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# 4. Use npm dedupe (deduplicate)
npm dedupe
```

### 7.4 How to Prevent Dependency Hell

| Practice | How | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| **Fewer dependencies** | Evaluate if you really need it | Fewer items = fewer conflicts |
| **Popular dependencies** | Prefer packages with many downloads | More tested, more compatible |
| **Update regularly** | `npm outdated` every week | Small, frequent updates < updating everything at once |
| **Use Dependabot** | Configure on GitHub | Updates automatically |
| **Test after updating** | CI/CD running tests | Catches conflicts early |
| **Lock file always** | Commit package-lock.json | Reproducible versions |

---

## 8. Dependency Security: Poisoned Items

### 8.1 The Risk of Dependencies

When you install a package, you trust someone else's code. This carries risks:

| Risk | Real Example | Consequence |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Malware** | event-stream (2018) -- popular package injected with malware | Stole Bitcoin |
| **Typosquatting** | `lodahs` instead of `lodash` -- fake package | Malware on install with typo |
| **Supply chain attack** | ua-parser-js (2021) -- package was hacked | Crypto miner installed on millions of projects |
| **Known vulnerability** | log4j (2021) -- critical flaw in Java library | Millions of vulnerable systems |

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** Poisoned items are like **fake Mushrooms** -- they look identical to the real Mushroom, but when Mario eats them, he SHRINKS instead of growing. Toad's Shop (npm) tries to verify items, but with 2 million items in stock, things slip through. It's up to the adventurer to check before consuming.

### 8.2 Security Audits

```bash
# npm: check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Automatically fix (when possible)
npm audit fix

# Fix with breaking changes (careful!)
npm audit fix --force

# pip (Python): needs pip-audit
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit

# Advanced tool: Snyk
npx snyk test
```

### 8.3 Dependabot and Renovate

**Dependabot** (GitHub native) and **Renovate** (open source) automate dependency updates:

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    reviewers:

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** Dependabot is the **Inspector Toad** who checks your backpack every week and says: "Hey, your Mushroom version 4.18.2 has a security flaw. Version 4.18.3 already exists and fixes it. Want to swap?" And opens an automatic PR for you to approve.

## 9. Monorepos and Workspaces: Shared Inventory

### 9.1 What Is a Monorepo

A **monorepo** is a single repository containing multiple projects that share dependencies:

```
todoapp-monorepo/
├── package.json          # Root: shared dependencies
├── packages/
│   ├── frontend/         # React project
│   │   └── package.json
│   ├── backend/          # Express project
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── shared/           # Shared code
│       └── package.json
```

### 9.2 Monorepo Tools

| Tool | Language | Approach |
|------|----------|----------|
| **npm workspaces** | JS/TS | Native in npm 7+ |
| **Yarn workspaces** | JS/TS | Native in Yarn |
| **pnpm workspaces** | JS/TS | Disk efficient |
| **Turborepo** | JS/TS | Build cache and parallelism |
| **Nx** | Multi-language | Enterprise, plugins |
| **Lerna** | JS/TS | Classic (now maintained by Nx) |

## 10. Best Practices: Inventory Rules

1. **Minimalism**: Install ONLY what's necessary. Each dependency is a risk and a weight.
2. **Evaluate before installing**: Check downloads, last update, open issues, license.
3. **Separate dev from prod**: Use `devDependencies` for development tools.
4. **Lock file in the repo**: ALWAYS commit package-lock.json / yarn.lock.
5. **Update frequently**: Small, frequent updates are safer than one giant update.
6. **Audit regularly**: `npm audit` at least weekly.
7. **Use Dependabot**: Automate security updates.
8. **Don't use `*` or `latest`**: Pin ranges with `^` or `~`.
9. **Check licenses**: Some packages have restrictive licenses (GPL can "contaminate" your project).
10. **Document decisions**: When choosing a package, note WHY in the PR/commit.

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** A wise adventurer doesn't fill their backpack with everything they see at the shop. They take only the essentials, check that each item is in good condition, note what they took and why, and inspect the backpack regularly to swap old items for better versions.

## 11. Final Summary Table

| Concept | What It Is | In Mario | Command/File |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Package** | Reusable published code | Item from Toad's Shop | `npm install x` |
| **Dependency** | Package your project needs | Essential item in the backpack | `dependencies` |
| **devDependency** | Package only for development | Training item | `devDependencies` |
| **Manager** | Tool that installs packages | Toad's Shop itself | npm, pip, NuGet |
| **Registry** | Central package repository | Shop's central warehouse | npmjs.com, pypi.org |
| **package.json** | Project dependency list | Official inventory | `npm init` |
| **Lock file** | Exact frozen versions | Inventory frozen in time | package-lock.json |
| **SemVer range** | Which versions are accepted | "I accept Mushrooms 4.x" | `^4.18.2`, `~4.18.2` |
| **Dependency hell** | Conflict between dependencies | Conflicting items in the backpack | `npm ls`, `overrides` |
| **Audit** | Check for vulnerabilities | Inspect poisoned items | `npm audit` |
| **Dependabot** | Automatic updates | Weekly Inspector Toad | `.github/dependabot.yml` |
