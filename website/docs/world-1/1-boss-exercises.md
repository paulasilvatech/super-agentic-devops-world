## Prologue — Bowser Jr. Awaits You

Sofia reached the end of World 1. Before her, a stone gate bearing the symbol of Bowser Jr. — the first boss of the journey. Behind the gate, ten challenge rooms. Each room tests a skill learned in the previous levels.

"You won't learn anything new here," said the voice. "You will PROVE that you've learned. Each quest is a challenge room. Complete them all and the gate opens. Bowser Jr. will be defeated. And you'll be ready for World 2."

The rules are simple:


---

## The Rules of the Boss Battle

| Rule | Description |
|------|-----------|
| **Do everything in practice** | Don't just read — open the terminal, VS Code, GitHub, and DO IT |
| **Document with screenshots** | Take screenshots of each completed step |
| **You can refer to the levels** | Going back to levels 1-1 through 1-7 is not defeat — it's strategy |
| **You can use Copilot** | The companion exists to be used — just don't let it do everything |
| **If you're stuck, skip ahead** | Try the next quest and come back later |
| **Suggested time** | 2-4 hours for all 10 quests |

---

## Quest 10 — Final Boss: The Mushroom Kingdom Project

**Reference level:** All (1-1 through 1-7)

  ```bash
  git switch -c feature/boss-battle
  ```

- [ ] **10.2** Create a file `boss-battle.js` that simulates a boss battle:
  ```javascript
  // ============================================
  // BOSS BATTLE — BOWSER JR.
  // ============================================
  // Create a program that:
  // 1. Defines the hero (name, lives, coins, power-ups)
  // 2. Defines the boss (Bowser Jr., with HP)
  // 3. Simulates 5 rounds of battle:
  //    - Each round, the hero attacks (random damage 10-30)
  //    - Each round, the boss attacks (hero loses 1 life with 30% chance)
  //    - If the hero has FireFlower, damage is doubled
  //    - If the hero has SuperStar, they don't lose lives that round
  // 4. At the end, shows who won
  //
  // TIP: Use Math.random() for random numbers
  // TIP: You can ask Copilot for help!
  ```
  **Implement the program.** Use Copilot as a companion, but review everything.

- [ ] **10.3** Test locally:
  ```bash
  node boss-battle.js
  ```

- [ ] **10.4** Create an Issue on GitHub:
  ```
  Title: feat: implement boss battle simulation

  with a damage, lives, and power-ups system.
  ```

- [ ] **10.5** Commit and push:
  ```bash
  git add boss-battle.js
  git commit -m "feat: implement boss battle against Bowser Jr (#4)"
  git push origin feature/boss-battle

- [ ] **10.8** Merge the PR

- [ ] **10.9** Update your local copy:
  ```bash
  git switch main
  git pull origin main
  ```

- [ ] **10.10** Run `git log --oneline` and take a final screenshot showing the full history

### Success Criteria

Working program, tested, version-controlled with Git, reviewed via PR, CI passing, merged to main. **The complete World 1 flow in action.**

> **MARIO ANALOGY:** This is the boss room. You used ALL your skills: the console (VS Code), the memory card (Git), the server (GitHub), the Lakitus (Actions), and the companion (Copilot). If you made it this far, Bowser Jr. has been defeated.

## Answer Key and Tips

### If you got stuck on Quest 6 (PR):
Remember: first create the branch, then make the changes, commit, push the branch, and only then create the PR on GitHub.

### If you got stuck on Quest 7 (Actions):
The YAML file path must be EXACTLY `.github/workflows/name.yml`. Watch your indentation (2 spaces, never tabs).

### If you got stuck on Quest 10 (Boss Battle):
Use Copilot! Write comments describing what you want and let Copilot suggest. Then review and adjust.

### General tip:
If something goes wrong, read the error message carefully. 90% of the time, the answer is in the error message itself.
