## Prologue: The Boss Rush Arena

Sofia entered the most feared room in the Final Castle: the **Boss Rush Arena**. The walls were decorated with trophies from the bosses of each World -- the Giant Goomba, the Blooper, Lakitu, Cheep-Cheep, Bowser Jr, Kamek, Magikoopa, and there in the back, in the shadows, the enormous silhouette of **Bowser** himself.

*"Congratulations on making it this far,"* said the voice. *"But before you claim final victory, you need to prove that you've mastered EVERYTHING you've learned. In this arena, you'll face 8 scenarios -- one for each World. Each scenario requires you to combine knowledge from multiple worlds. It's not enough to know how to jump -- you need to know how to jump, shoot, fly, and swim all at the same time."*

Sofia adjusted her power-ups. It was time for the Boss Rush.

## How the Boss Rush Works

Each boss follows this structure:

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  STRUCTURE OF EACH BOSS                          |
|                                                  |
|  1. SCENARIO: Real situation you face            |
|  2. YOUR MISSION: What you need to do            |
|  3. TOAD'S TIPS: Clues for the solution          |
|  4. GUIDED SOLUTION: Detailed step by step       |
|  5. REQUIRED POWER-UPS: Worlds involved          |
|                                                  |
|  INCREASING DIFFICULTY:                          |
|  Boss 1: [==--------] Easy                       |
|  Boss 2: [===-------] Easy+                      |
|  Boss 3: [=====-----] Medium                     |
|  Boss 4: [======----] Medium+                    |
|  Boss 5: [=======---] Hard                       |
|  Boss 6: [========--] Hard+                      |
|  Boss 7: [==========-] Expert                    |
|  Boss F: [==========] FINAL                      |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**Rule**: Try to solve each scenario BEFORE looking at the guided solution. Real learning comes from trying.

## Boss 1: The Giant Goomba (World 1 -- Fundamentals)

**Difficulty**: [==--------] Easy
**Main World**: 1 (Green Plains)
**Combined Worlds**: 1 + 3

### Scenario

You've just been hired as a junior developer at MushKingdom Tech. On your first day, your tech lead Pedro says:

*"Welcome! We have a project called `mushroom-store`. I need you to: clone the repository, create a branch for your feature, make a simple change (add your name to the README), commit with a standard message, and open a Pull Request. The repository is on the company's GitHub."*

### Your Mission

1. Clone the `mushroom-store` repository from GitHub
2. Create a branch called `feature/add-sofia-to-team`
3. Add your name to the contributors list in README.md
4. Commit following the Conventional Commits standard
5. Push the branch
6. Open a Pull Request on GitHub
7. Ensure the CI (GitHub Actions) passes

### Toad's Tips

- Remember the basic flow: clone -> branch -> edit -> commit -> push -> PR
- Conventional Commits: `docs: add Sofia to contributors list`
- The CI may fail if the README has a formatting error (Markdown lint)
- Check if `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists before pushing

### Guided Solution

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository (W1 - Git)
git clone https://github.com/mushkingdom/mushroom-store.git
cd mushroom-store

# Step 2: Create branch (W1 - Git)
git checkout -b feature/add-sofia-to-team

# Step 3: Edit the README (W1 - VS Code)
# Open VS Code and add to the README:
# ## Contributors
# - Pedro (Tech Lead)
# - Sofia (Junior Developer) <-- NEW

# Step 4: Commit with standard (W1 - Git + W3 - Best Practices)
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: add Sofia to contributors list"

# Step 5: Push (W1 - Git + GitHub)
git push -u origin feature/add-sofia-to-team

# Step 6: Open PR on GitHub (W1 - GitHub)
# Go to GitHub > Pull Requests > New Pull Request
# Base: main <- Compare: feature/add-sofia-to-team
# Title: "docs: add Sofia to contributors list"
# Description: "Adding Sofia as a new project contributor"

# Step 7: Verify CI (W1 - GitHub Actions)
# Wait for the CI workflow to run and check if it passed
# If it failed: read the logs, fix, commit again
```

### Required Power-Ups

| Power-Up | World | Usage |
|----------|-------|-------|
| VS Code | W1 | Editor for making changes |
| Git | W1 | Clone, branch, commit, push |
| GitHub | W1 | PR and collaboration |
| GitHub Actions | W1 | Automated CI |
| Conventional Commits | W3 | Message standard |

## Boss 2: The Blooper from the Depths (World 2 -- Infrastructure)

**Difficulty**: [===-------] Easy+
**Main World**: 2 (Caves)
**Combined Worlds**: 1 + 2 + 3

### Scenario

The team receives a complaint: *"The site is down!"*. You check and the site really isn't responding. The tech lead asks:

*"I need you to investigate: check the environments (dev, staging, prod), look at the logs, find out if it's a DNS, API, or database problem, and give me a diagnosis."*

### Your Mission

1. Check which environment has the problem (dev, staging, production)
2. Check if DNS is resolving correctly
3. Verify if the API responds (endpoint /health)
4. Verify if the database is accessible
5. Analyze the logs on the observability dashboard
6. Create an issue on GitHub with the diagnosis
7. Propose a solution

### Toad's Tips

- Start with the basics: `ping`, `nslookup`, `curl`
- If DNS resolves but the API doesn't respond, the problem is on the server
- If the API responds but with a 500 error, the problem might be the database
- Logs are your best friends -- look for "ERROR" and "FATAL"
- The real problem: the SSL certificate expired yesterday at 23:59

### Guided Solution

```bash
# Step 1: Check DNS (W2 - DNS)
nslookup mushroom-store.com
# Result: Resolves to 20.30.40.50 -- DNS OK

# Step 2: Check connectivity (W2 - Infrastructure)
curl -v https://mushroom-store.com/health
# Result: SSL_ERROR_EXPIRED_CERT -- FOUND!

# Step 3: Check certificate (W2 - Security)
openssl s_client -connect mushroom-store.com:443 2>/dev/null | \
  openssl x509 -noout -dates
# notAfter=Mar 17 23:59:59 2026 GMT  <-- EXPIRED YESTERDAY!

# Step 4: Check environments (W2 - Environments)
curl -k https://staging.mushroom-store.com/health
# Result: {"status": "healthy"} -- Staging OK (different cert)
curl -k https://mushroom-store.com/health
# Result: {"status": "healthy"} -- API works, cert expired

# Step 5: Analyze logs (W2 - Observability)
# In Grafana/Azure Monitor: filter by "SSL" or "certificate"
# Found: "WARNING: Certificate expires in 1 day" (yesterday)

# Step 6: Create issue (W1 - GitHub)
# Title: "fix: SSL certificate expired on production"
# Description:
#   Root cause: SSL certificate expired on 2026-03-17
#   Impact: site inaccessible via HTTPS in production
#   Staging not affected (different certificate)
#   Solution: renew certificate + set up auto-renewal

# Step 7: Solution (W2 - DevOps/IaC)
# Renew certificate via Let's Encrypt:
# certbot renew --force-renewal
# Set up cron job for auto-renewal:
# 0 3 1 * * certbot renew --quiet
```

### Required Power-Ups

| Power-Up | World | Usage |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Terminal | W3 | Diagnostic commands |
| DNS | W2 | Verify name resolution |
| Security | W2 | Diagnose SSL certificate |
| Observability | W2 | Analyze logs |
| Environments | W2 | Check dev vs staging vs prod |
| GitHub Issues | W1 | Document the problem |

## Boss 3: The Evil Lakitu (World 3 -- Tools)

**Difficulty**: [=====-----] Medium
**Main World**: 3 (Sky World)
**Combined Worlds**: 1 + 2 + 3 + 5

### Scenario

The team needs a **new development environment** that any developer can spin up in minutes. Today, each dev spends 2-3 hours configuring the environment manually. The tech lead asks:

*"Create a Docker Compose that brings up the entire application: React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL, and Redis. Add automated tests and configure Copilot to help."*

### Your Mission

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` with 4 services (frontend, backend, db, redis)
2. Create optimized Dockerfiles with multi-stage build for frontend and backend
3. Configure volumes for database persistence
4. Add healthchecks for all services
5. Create a `setup.sh` script that configures everything at once
6. Write tests that verify if services are healthy
7. Use Copilot to help with creation (record which prompts you used)

### Toad's Tips

- Multi-stage build: use one image for build and another for runtime
- Healthchecks: `curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1`
- Named volumes for PostgreSQL: `pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data`
- Redis doesn't need a volume (cache is ephemeral)
- Use `.env` for environment variables (never hardcode passwords)

### Guided Solution

```

```bash
# Prompt used in Copilot (W5):
# "Create a docker-compose.yml for an application with
#  React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL and Redis.
#  Include healthchecks, multi-stage Dockerfiles and
#  volumes for database persistence."

# Integration tests (W3 - Tests):
# test/integration/docker-health.test.js
```

## Boss 4: The Poisonous Cheep-Cheep (World 4 -- Architecture)

**Difficulty**: [======----] Medium+
**Main World**: 4 (Aquatic World)
**Combined Worlds**: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4

### Scenario

The mushroom-store is growing and the monolith can't handle it anymore. The CTO decides to migrate to **microservices** and implement **blue-green deploy**. You are responsible for:

*"Break the products module into an independent microservice. Configure JWT authentication between services. Implement blue-green deploy on Azure. Everything needs to have zero downtime."*

### Your Mission

1. Extract the products module from the monolith into a microservice
2. Define the REST API for the new service (OpenAPI/Swagger)
3. Implement JWT authentication for service-to-service communication
4. Configure the blue-green deploy pipeline
5. Implement health checks and readiness probes
6. Create a rollback plan in case something goes wrong
7. Document the new architecture

### Toad's Tips

- Blue-green: two identical environments, instant traffic switch
- JWT between services: service-to-service auth, not the same as user auth
- Use API Gateway to route traffic between blue and green
- Rollback = point traffic back to the previous environment
- Zero downtime = mandatory health check before releasing traffic

### Guided Solution

## Boss 5: Bowser Jr (World 5 -- AI and Agents)

**Difficulty**: [=======---] Hard
**Main World**: 5 (Bowser's Castle 1)
**Combined Worlds**: 1 + 3 + 4 + 5

### Scenario

Your app has a **production bug** that is affecting 30% of users: the shopping cart randomly loses items. The CTO demands urgent resolution. You need to use all AI tools to solve it fast.

*"Use Copilot to find the bug, fix it, make sure it doesn't come back, and deploy the fix. We have 2 hours."*

### Your Mission

1. Use `git bisect` to find the commit that introduced the bug
2. Use Copilot Agent Mode to analyze and propose the fix
3. Implement the fix with Copilot's help
4. Create tests that verify the bug doesn't come back (regression)
5. Configure GHAS to scan for related vulnerabilities
6. Do an emergency deploy (hotfix)
7. Monitor that the fix resolved the problem

### Toad's Tips

- `git bisect` is perfect for finding when a bug was introduced
- The bug is likely a race condition in Redis (cache invalidation)
- Copilot's Agent Mode can analyze the code and suggest a fix quickly
- Hotfix: create branch from `main`, fix, merge directly (bypass feature branch)
- Monitor the error rate after deploy to confirm the fix

### Guided Solution

```bash
# Step 1: Find the guilty commit (W1 - Advanced Git)
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD              # current version has the bug
git bisect good v2.2.0           # last version without the bug
# Git will checkout intermediate commits
# For each one, test: does the cart lose items?
# Result: commit abc123 "feat: add Redis caching to cart"
git bisect reset
```

```
# Step 2: Analyze with Copilot Agent Mode (W5)
Sofia in Copilot:
  "Analyze commit abc123 that added Redis cache to the
   cart. Users are randomly losing items.
   I suspect a race condition in cache invalidation.
   Analyze src/services/cart.ts and src/cache/redis.ts"

Copilot (Agent Mode):
  "I found the problem. In cart.ts:87, the updateCart() method
   updates the database AFTER invalidating the cache. If another
   request arrives between the invalidation and the database update,
   the cache will be reloaded with stale data (stale read).

   Suggested fix: use the cache-aside pattern -- update the database
   FIRST, then invalidate the cache. Or use a distributed lock."
```

```typescript
// Step 3: Implement fix (W5 - Copilot + W3 - Code)

// BEFORE (bug): invalidates cache, then updates database
async updateCart(userId: string, items: CartItem[]) {
  await this.cache.del(`cart:${userId}`);     // invalidate
  await this.db.cart.update({ userId, items }); // update
  // BUG: between del() and update(), another request reads
  // empty cache and reloads stale data from the database
}

// AFTER (fix): updates database, then invalidates cache
async updateCart(userId: string, items: CartItem[]) {
  await this.db.cart.update({ userId, items }); // update FIRST
  await this.cache.del(`cart:${userId}`);        // then invalidate
  // SAFE: even if another request reloads the cache,
  // it will get the NEW data from the database
}
```

```bash
# Step 4: Regression tests (W3 - Tests)
# test/regression/cart-race-condition.test.ts
# Test that simulates concurrent requests to the cart
# and verifies that items are not lost

# Step 5: GHAS scan (W5 - Security)
# Check if there are other similar race conditions in the code

# Step 6: Hotfix deploy (W4 - Deploy + W1 - Git)
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/cart-race-condition
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve cart race condition in Redis cache invalidation"
git push -u origin hotfix/cart-race-condition
# Create PR -> Quick merge -> Automatic deploy

# Step 7: Monitor (W2 - Observability)
# Grafana: monitor cart error rate

## Boss 6: Kamek the Illusionist (World 6 -- Copilot Ecosystem)

**Difficulty**: [========--] Hard+
**Main World**: 6 (Bowser's Castle 2)
**Combined Worlds**: 1 + 3 + 5 + 6

### Scenario

The company wants to **standardize** GitHub Copilot usage for the entire team of 20 developers. Today, each one uses it their own way -- no custom agents, no skills, no instructions. The result: inconsistent prompts, code without standards, and wasted tokens.

*"Configure the complete Copilot ecosystem for our project: agents, skills, instructions, prompts, hooks, and MCP. I want any new dev to be productive on their first day."*

### Your Mission

1. Create the `copilot-instructions.md` with project standards
2. Create 3 Custom Agents (.agent.md): Backend, Frontend, and DBA
3. Create 2 Skills (SKILL.md): workflow-feature and workflow-bugfix
4. Create 2 Prompt Files (.prompt.md): new-component and add-endpoint
5. Configure Hooks (pre-commit and commit-msg)
6. Configure MCP to connect to PostgreSQL and Figma
7. Document everything for the team

### Toad's Tips

- copilot-instructions.md goes in the `.github/` root
- Agents go in `.github/agents/`
- Skills go in `.github/skills/`
- Prompts go in `.github/prompts/`
- MCP goes in `.vscode/mcp.json`
- Hooks go via Husky in `package.json`

### Guided Solution

```markdown
# Step 1: copilot-instructions.md (W6 - Instructions)
# .github/copilot-instructions.md

# Copilot Instructions - MushKingdom Store

## Stack
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript 5 + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js 20 + Express + Prisma
- Database: PostgreSQL 16
- Cache: Redis 7
- Tests: Jest + React Testing Library

## Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode, zero `any`
- Conventional Commits (feat, fix, docs, chore)
- Repository Pattern for data access
- Variable and function names in English
- Comments in Portuguese

## Standards
- Every public function must have JSDoc
- Every endpoint must have validation with Zod
- Every service must have unit tests (>80% coverage)
```

## Boss 7: The Supreme Magikoopa (World 7 -- AI Frameworks)

**Difficulty**: [==========-] Expert
**Main World**: 7 (Star World)
**Combined Worlds**: 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7

### Scenario

MushKingdom Tech's support team receives 200+ tickets per day. 60% are questions that the documentation already answers. The CTO wants:

*"Build a RAG agent that answers customer questions using our documentation. Use AI Foundry, connect via MCP, and publish on the IDP. The agent must know when it doesn't know and escalate to humans."*

### Your Mission

1. Index the product documentation in Azure AI Search
2. Configure a GPT-4o model in Azure AI Foundry
3. Create a RAG flow: question -> search -> context -> response
4. Implement guardrails: detection of out-of-scope topics
5. Configure automatic escalation to a human when the agent doesn't know
6. Connect the agent to the ticket system via MCP
7. Publish the agent on the IDP/Backstage as a cataloged service
8. Define success metrics (automatic resolution, satisfaction)

### Toad's Tips

- Azure AI Search to index documents in 500-token chunks
- Use embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002) for vector representation
- The system prompt should instruct the agent to say "I don't know" when it can't find relevant documentation
- Confidence threshold: if score < 0.7, escalate to a human
- Custom MCP server to connect to the ticket system (Zendesk, Jira Service Desk, etc.)

### Guided Solution

```

  (or escalates to human if score < 0.7)
```

```python
# Simplified RAG flow (W7 - RAG + AI Foundry)
from azure.search.documents import SearchClient
from openai import AzureOpenAI

# 1. Search for relevant documents
search_client = SearchClient(endpoint, index_name, credential)
results = search_client.search(
    search_text=None,
    vector_queries=[{
        "kind": "vector",
        "vector": get_embedding(user_question),
        "k_nearest_neighbors": 5,
        "fields": "content_vector"
    }]
)

# 2. Check confidence
top_score = results[0]['@search.score']
if top_score < 0.7:
    escalate_to_human(user_question)
    return "I'll transfer you to a specialized agent."

# 3. Build context
context = "\n".join([r['content'] for r in results])

# 4. Generate response with GPT-4o
client = AzureOpenAI(endpoint=ai_endpoint, api_key=ai_key)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": f"""

## FINAL Boss: The Ultimate Bowser (All Worlds)

**Difficulty**: [==========] FINAL
**Main World**: ALL
**Combined Worlds**: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7

### Scenario

MushKingdom Tech has been acquired by a larger company. You need to **migrate the entire ecosystem** to a new infrastructure, keeping everything running. The challenge:

*"We have 30 days to migrate the repository, the infrastructure, the CI/CD, the agents, the RAG, and the IDP to the new GitHub organization. Zero downtime. No data lost. All agents need to keep working. And we need to document EVERYTHING for the new team."*

### Your Mission

1. **Plan** the migration (timeline, dependencies, risks)
2. **Migrate repositories** to the new GitHub organization (W1)
3. **Reconfigure environments** and secrets in the new infra (W2)
4. **Migrate containers** and Docker pipelines (W3)
5. **Update deploy** to point to the new Azure (W4)
6. **Migrate Copilot configuration** (agents, skills, instructions, MCP) (W5+W6)
7. **Migrate RAG agent** and reindex documents (W7)
8. **Update IDP** with new endpoints and owners (W7)
9. **Test EVERYTHING** end-to-end
10. **Document** for the new team
11. **Monitor** for 2 weeks post-migration (W2)
12. **Present** final report to leadership (W8)

### Toad's Tips

- Do it in phases: infra first, then code, then AI
- Use blue-green for the switch: new environment running in parallel
- Secrets should never be copied in plain text -- use Azure Key Vault
- GitHub Importer to migrate repos with complete history
- MCP configs need new tokens/credentials
- RAG needs to reindex -- embeddings are not portable between AI Search accounts
