## Prologue: The Definitive Encyclopedia

In the Mushroom Kingdom, every great hero carries an encyclopedia -- a book that contains the meaning of every item, enemy, terrain, and power that exists in the game universe. Without it, the player confuses a Goomba with a Koopa, doesn't know the difference between a Fire Flower and an Ice Flower, and gets lost in the underground tunnels.

This encyclopedia is yours. It contains **120+ terms** that cover all 8 Worlds -- from Git to RAG, from Docker to IDP, from API to Webhook. Each term has its technical definition, its Mario analogy, and the World where it was introduced.

*"When you're lost, come back here. The encyclopedia always has the answer."*

#### Repository (Repo)
- **Definition**: A directory that contains the project's code, its Git history, and metadata.
- **In Mario**: World map -- where everything is organized: levels, items, characters.
- **World**: W1
- **Practical example**: `https://github.com/mushkingdom/mushroom-store`

#### REST (Representational State Transfer)
- **Definition**: An architectural style for APIs that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URLs to access resources.
- **In Mario**: The Mushroom Kingdom's standard postal system -- clear rules for how to send and receive packages.
- **World**: W2
- **Practical example**: `GET /api/products/42` returns the product with ID 42.

#### Rollback
- **Definition**: Reverting a deployment or change to the previous version when something goes wrong.
- **In Mario**: Going back to the last checkpoint -- when you die, you return exactly where you saved.
- **World**: W4
- **Practical example**: `az webapp deployment slot swap` to revert to the previous version.

### S

#### Secret Scanning
- **Definition**: A GHAS tool that automatically detects keys, tokens, and passwords committed accidentally.
- **In Mario**: Anti-theft alarm -- if someone steals the castle key, the alarm goes off immediately.
- **World**: W5
- **Practical example**: GitHub detecting an AWS API key committed in a `.ts` file.

#### Semantic Kernel
- **Definition**: A Microsoft SDK for integrating LLMs into applications, with support for plugins and planning.
- **In Mario**: Universal magic engine -- works with any spell (model) and any wizard (agent).
- **World**: W7
- **Practical example**: Creating an agent with Semantic Kernel that uses plugins to access databases and APIs.

#### Skill (Copilot)
- **Definition**: A reusable set of instructions that teach Copilot to perform a specific task.
- **In Mario**: Power-Up -- equipment that gives the character a specific ability (Mushroom = grow, Star = invincibility).
- **World**: W6
- **Practical example**: Skill `workflow-feature` that guides Copilot through the Plan -> Implement -> Review -> Verify flow.

#### SQL (Structured Query Language)
- **Definition**: A standard language for querying and manipulating relational databases.
- **In Mario**: The language of the data guardians -- it's how you ask the data castle guardian for information.
- **World**: W3
- **Practical example**: `INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Star', 50)`

#### SSL/TLS
- **Definition**: Encryption protocols that ensure secure communication between client and server.
- **In Mario**: Armored tunnel between castles -- no one can spy on what's being transported.
- **World**: W2
- **Practical example**: HTTPS uses TLS to encrypt communication between browser and server.

### T

#### Terminal
- **Definition**: A command-line interface that allows executing commands directly on the operating system.
- **In Mario**: Command console -- direct access to the game engine, raw power in the right hands.
- **World**: W3
- **Practical example**: `ls -la`, `cd project/`, `npm run dev`

#### Terraform
- **Definition**: An IaC tool that lets you define and provision cloud infrastructure in configuration files.
- **In Mario**: Magic castle blueprint -- you draw the castle on paper and it builds itself.
- **World**: W2
- **Practical example**: `terraform apply` creates all the Azure infrastructure defined in `.tf` files.

#### Token (AI)
- **Definition**: The smallest unit of text processed by an AI model -- approximately 4 characters in English.
- **In Mario**: Coin -- the basic unit of cost in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every Copilot action costs coins.
- **World**: W6
- **Practical example**: "Hello world" = 2 tokens; each interaction with Copilot consumes tokens.

#### TypeScript
- **Definition**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, increasing safety and productivity.
- **In Mario**: Hero's armor -- protects from invisible bugs (type errors) that plain JavaScript doesn't detect.
- **World**: W3
- **Practical example**: `function add(a: number, b: number): number { return a + b; }`

### U

#### Unit Test
- **Definition**: A test that verifies the behavior of an individual unit of code (function, method, class).
- **In Mario**: Training against a single enemy -- practicing a specific move until it's perfect.
- **World**: W3
- **Practical example**: `test('calculateTotal returns correct sum', () => expect(calculateTotal([10, 20])).toBe(30))`

#### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
- **Definition**: An address that identifies a resource on the web.
- **In Mario**: Map coordinates -- they tell exactly where something is: world, level, and position.
- **World**: W2
- **Practical example**: `https://mushroom-store.com/api/products/42`

### V

#### VS Code (Visual Studio Code)
- **Definition**: A free, extensible code editor from Microsoft, the most popular in the world.
- **In Mario**: The game console -- the main controller where everything happens; without it, you can't play.
- **World**: W1
- **Practical example**: Opening VS Code, installing extensions, editing code, using the integrated terminal.

#### Volume (Docker)
- **Definition**: A data persistence mechanism in Docker that survives container restarts.
- **In Mario**: Permanent treasure chest -- the items stay there even if you reset the level.
- **World**: W3
- **Practical example**: `volumes: pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data` preserves PostgreSQL data.

### W

#### Webhook
- **Definition**: An HTTP notification mechanism that sends data automatically when an event occurs.
- **In Mario**: "?" Block that notifies other worlds -- when you hit the block, a signal is sent to another castle.
- **World**: W1, W2
- **Practical example**: A push to GitHub triggers a webhook that activates the CI/CD pipeline.

#### Workflow (GitHub Actions)
- **Definition**: A YAML file that defines an automated sequence of tasks in GitHub Actions.
- **In Mario**: Level script -- defines each obstacle, enemy, and power-up in sequence.
- **World**: W1
- **Practical example**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` defining build, test, and deploy.

### X

#### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- **Definition**: A security vulnerability where malicious code is injected into web pages.
- **In Mario**: Enemy disguised as a coin -- looks like something good, but when you grab it, it hurts you.
- **World**: W2
- **Practical example**: Sanitizing user inputs to prevent injection of malicious scripts.

### Y

#### YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)
- **Definition**: A human-readable data serialization format used in configurations.
- **In Mario**: The language of maps -- the format in which Mushroom Kingdom maps are written.
- **World**: W1
- **Practical example**: GitHub Actions, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes files use YAML.

### Z

#### Zero Trust
- **Definition**: A security model that assumes no entity is trustworthy by default, always verifying.
- **In Mario**: No one enters the castle without verification -- not even Mario! Even inside, every door requires a new check.
- **World**: W2
- **Practical example**: Authenticate and authorize EVERY request, even within the internal network.

#### Zod
- **Definition**: A TypeScript library for schema validation, used to ensure received data is valid.
- **In Mario**: Item verifier at the castle entrance -- confirms every item is real and valid before letting it in.
- **World**: W3
- **Practical example**: `const schema = z.object({ name: z.string(), price: z.number().positive() })`
